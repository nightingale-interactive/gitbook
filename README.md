## Story

In the peaceful meadows of Sugarland, shepherds and their sheep thrived in a sweet paradise, where the very air was tinged with the scent of candies and snacks. These sweet treats formed the heart of Sugarland's charm, not only for its residents but also for the sheep that roamed the candy-filled meadows. It was a place where sugar and smiles were in abundance.

As the word of Sugarland's sweet existence spread, more and more people came in search of this extraordinary sweetness. However, the influx of settlers brought unforeseen challenges, particularly the shortage of pastures for their beloved sheep. Once-peaceful settlements faced new obstacles.

Wise wizards and caring rulers embarked on a quest for a solution. After extensive research and magical experimentation, they unveiled an innovative answer: a virtual dimension crafted just for sheep, known as _Meta-land_. Here, the sheep could continue to graze on sweet treats, and the bond between shepherds and their fluffy friends would remain unbroken.

Farmers and their sheep journeyed to Meta-land, where the weather was always pleasant, the pastures lush, and the snacks abundant. As the wizards continued their work to perfect this haven, Meta-land's story was just beginning to unfold, promising more enchanting locations for all to explore.

In the sweet realm of Sugarland, nestled on Mallowbu Island, a place renowned for its warm and welcoming residents, a cherished tradition unfolded each year â€“ the crowning of the Legendary Runner Sheep. This event brought immense pride and joy to Mallowbu's people, who celebrated with races lined with candy decorations and valuable prizes.

With the portal to Meta-land now open, the kind-hearted folks of Mallowbu made a heartfelt decision to share their cherished tradition with the rest of the world. Inspired by the enchanting themes of the diverse villages in Sugarland, Sheep Racing was expanded to include participants from near and far.

Join us in this journey of sheep farming, adventure, and friendly competition as you nurture your sheep in the perfect pastures of Meta-land, and perhaps, one day, your own sheep will earn the coveted title of _Legendary Runner_!
