|     ![](../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_st\_speed.png)     |   Speed   | The speed stat indicates how fast a sheep is capable of running.                                                                                                   |
| ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_st\_stamina (1).png>) |  Stamina  | Stamina determines the length of time a sheep can continue to run at top speed.                                                                                    |
|     ![](../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_st\_power.png)     |   Power   | A sheep's power represents its ability to outrun and overtake other sheep, as well as to maintain its position once it has gained ground.                          |
|    ![](../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_st\_balance.png)    |  Balance  | Balance affects the running stability of sheep. It not only helps your sheep get a strong start in the race, but it also reduces the chance that they may stumble. |
|   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_st\_mentality.png)   |   Spirit  | Spirit is an indicator of a sheep's capacity to better withstand fatigue and enables them to make more frequent use of their skills.                               |

_\*Updates later this year will include features relating to stumbling or skill use while running._



* **Dash-Time**

At some point during a race, a sheep will reach its top speed, which is known as its "Dash-time‚Äù. Each sheep has a particular zone where their Dash-time will go into effect. A sheep's stamina is continually being depleted while they run, and during their Dash-time, it is used significantly more.
