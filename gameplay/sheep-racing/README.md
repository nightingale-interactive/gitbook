Sheep Racing is a type of player-versus-player (PvP) activity in which players compete with one another by entering tournaments. Players have the option to vote for the weather conditions that will occur during races, place bets on their favourite sheep, and even just observe the action from the sidelines. Spectators are more than welcome to enjoy the activity without owning any of our NFTs!
