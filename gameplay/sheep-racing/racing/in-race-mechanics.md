1. A position bar that depicts the placement of sheep and their proximity to the finish line is displayed in the top left corner of the screen.
2. The bottom tray contains a fast forward button that allows you to advance in time. It also includes a camera button that enables you to toggle between sheep and follow them on screen. This will display their position as well as their pace. Additionally, you can modify the audio settings by clicking on the gear button.





### Stumbling

Stumbling is a random event that occurs during a race. When a sheep stumbles during a race, its speed decreases for a short period of time. The frequency of sheep stumbling is influenced by both their Balance and Spirit stats. The faster a sheep is running, the greater its chance of becoming disoriented and stumbling. A better Balance stat gives sheep a better chance of staying on their feet and avoiding stumbling.
