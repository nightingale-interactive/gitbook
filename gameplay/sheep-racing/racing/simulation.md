# Practice Run

The Practice Run feature lets you watch demo versions of races for a cost of one Scope. Learn the tracks, refine your abilities, and adapt strategies to improve your own skills and understanding.



The odds of placement for each individual sheep are also determined, factoring in their attributes and the various kinds of weather. Analyze the moves, decision-making, and skills of top performing sheep to enhance your betting experience.



The Practice Run feature is suitable for both newcomers and seasoned racers. This helps gain valuable racing knowledge, however, there is no guarantee that the results of the real event will be the same as those of the simulation.



Invest one Scope, take your skills to new heights, conquer the track and become a champion!
