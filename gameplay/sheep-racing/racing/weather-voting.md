# Weather Voting

During a sheep race, the weather can have a significant impact on the outcome of the contest, and our [DAO service](https://sheepfarm.io/dao) allows users to vote for the weather forecast they believe will be most favourable to their chances of winning.



### **Weather Effects**

The skills of sheep can be affected by the weather in a number of ways:

**Sunny -** Speed is increased by 10%

**Rainy -** Stamina and Balance both receive a 10% increase

**Snowy -** A 10% increase in both Power and Spirit

**Stormy -** Grants a 6% increase to all stats.

A **GO VOTE** option is included in a raceâ€™s information, and it allows you to vote on the type of weather you would want to see during a specific race.



Alternatively, you can directly navigate to our website's DAO menu, where you can view a list of polls to vote on. In this section, you'll also be able to view the history of your own voting as well as the number of votes that a certain weather condition has received for a particular race.



Keep in mind that you'll require vNGIT (a voting token) in order to cast your vote; you can learn more about obtaining them [here](https://guide.sheepfarm.io/guide/economy/nightingale-token-ngit/vngit).
