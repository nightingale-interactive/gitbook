# Odds

### **Odds Indicator**

The odds indicator can be toggled between ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/initiatialOdd.PNG) and ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/newOdd.PNG).\
The ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/initiatialOdd.PNG) signifies the game's default setting and indicates the opening odds of the race. The opening odds reflect what the bookmaker predicts will happen in any given situation, and since the calculated odds are based on roughly 50 simulation runs, they can be trusted as a starting point. \


As more players bet, the mathematics of the book changes, and as a result, the bookmaker is required to adjust the odds accordingly. Toggling the indicator to ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/newOdd.PNG) will display the current odds for each contender in the race.
