1. You can purchase tickets to use for betting by selecting the button that is located next to your current betting ticket balance.
2. You can pay for your tickets directly with your in-game MARD after inputting the number of tickets you want to purchase. Tickets cost 1 MARD each.

As an alternative, if you attempt to place a bet without owning betting tickets, you will be prompted to purchase some before continuing. This will lead you right to where you may purchase tickets.
