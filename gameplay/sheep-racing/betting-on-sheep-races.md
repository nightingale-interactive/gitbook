Ready to try your luck and test your instincts? Within Sheep Racing, Betting serves as the gateway to a deeper engagement with the races. Whether you're an experienced bettor or new to the concept, this section allows you to participate actively in the races.

##

## Practice Runs

Before the actual race, you have the option to watch a practice run, providing valuable insights into what to expect. For a single [Scope](../consumable-items.md), you can access this feature and view demo versions of races. Utilize this opportunity to familiarize yourself with the tracks, refine your skills, and adapt strategies to improve your racing proficiency.



The odds for each individual sheep are also factored into practice runs, taking into account their attributes and the prevailing weather conditions. However, it's important to keep in mind that the results of the real event may differ from those of the simulation.



## Odds

The concept of odds is essential in Sheep Racing, and it's important to understand how they work.

**Initial Odds:** Initial Odds represent the game's default setting and serve as the starting point for the race. These opening odds are calculated based on what the bookmaker predicts will happen, drawing from approximately 50 Practice Runs. As such, they offer a reliable initial reference point for the race.

**Changing Odds:** As more players place their bets, the dynamics of the book change. Consequently, the bookmaker must adjust the odds to reflect the evolving betting patterns. You can track these changes by toggling the "Current Odds" indicator, which provides real-time updates on the odds for each contender in the race.



## Placing Bets

In Sheep Racing, there are two exciting ways to try your luck and potentially earn valuable rewards:
