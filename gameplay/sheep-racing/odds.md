#### **Odds Indicator**

The odds indicator can be toggled between _**I**_ and _**N**_. The letter _**N**_ signifies the game's default setting and indicates the opening odds of the race. The opening odds reflect what the bookmaker predicts will happen in any given situation. As more players bet, the mathematics of the book changes, and as a result, the bookmaker is required to adjust the odds accordingly. Toggling the indicator to the letter _**I**_ will display the current odds for each contender in the race.
