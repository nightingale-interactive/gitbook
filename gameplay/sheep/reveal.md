# Reveal

In Meta-Land, each individual sheep has its own personality and attributes. Each one of them wields a set of hidden powers that are just waiting to be revealed. You can get to know your sheep on a deeper level and discover the attributes they hold.



The rarer the sheep, the more attributes they will be able to unlock. The following table gives an overview of the total range of Min/Max attribute values for each rarity:&#x20;

| Rarity | MIN | MAX |
| :----: | :-: | :-: |
| Normal | 200 | 240 |
|  Rare  | 240 | 280 |
|  Epic  | 280 | 320 |
