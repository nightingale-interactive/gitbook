# Sheep Attributes

Sheep possess a unique set of abilities that influence how well they compete in tournaments. Rarer sheep have more natural potential and will exhibit more significant attributes.



### **Attributes**

|                          Icon                          | Attribute | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :-------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|     ![](../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_st\_speed.png)     |   Speed   | The speed stat indicates how fast a sheep is capable of running.                                                                                                   |
| ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_st\_stamina (1).png>) |  Stamina  | Stamina determines the length of time a sheep can continue to run at top speed.                                                                                    |
|     ![](../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_st\_power.png)     |   Power   | A sheep's power represents its ability to outrun and overtake other sheep, as well as to maintain its position once it has gained ground.                          |
|    ![](../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_st\_balance.png)    |  Balance  | Balance affects the running stability of sheep. It not only helps your sheep get a strong start in the race, but it also reduces the chance that they may stumble. |
|   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/icon\_st\_mentality.png)   |   Spirit  | Spirit is an indicator of a sheep's capacity to better withstand fatigue and enables them to make more frequent use of their skills.                               |

### **Dash-Time**

At some point during a race, a sheep will reach its top speed, which is known as its _Dash-time_, and is represented by a Dashometer bar alongside the other attributes of a sheep. This bar shows at what point during a race a sheep will activate its _Dash-time_ in order to boost their speed at the optimal moment. The stamina of a sheep will always be depleted while it is running, but during _Dash**-**time_, it will be consumed significantly more.\
