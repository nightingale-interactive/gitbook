In Sheepfarm, you have access to two distinct seasonal passes: the basic pass (free), provided by Katie, and the premium pass (paid), offered by Eddie. These passes open doors to various rewards and progression opportunities in the game.



To earn rewards and experience points to advance through the pass levels, complete daily and weekly missions. As you level up, you'll unlock rewards that can enhance your sheep farming journey.



Keep in mind that these passes are tied to seasons, so be sure to make the most of them before the season ends.
