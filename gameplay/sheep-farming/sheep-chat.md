# Sheep Chat

This is a new feature in **Sheep Farm** that lets you chat with your sheep using an AI-powered chatbot. The chatbot has been trained on a large dataset of sheep-related information, like their behaviour and preferences. When you chat with your sheep, the chatbot interprets what you say and generates responses from the sheep's perspective. The more you chat, the smarter your sheep will get!



To use Sheep Chat, you'll need to spend **10 Rainbow Beanz** per chat. Rainbow Beanz can be obtained for _free_ by taking part in the 1st mobile CBT, or (soon) be purchased through the mobile app store or the MARD [shop](https://sheepfarm.io/shop) on our website.



Not only is Sheep Chat a fun and engaging way to interact with your flock, but it also offers a chance to win random bonus reward items every 10th interaction.



Here's table that shows all the rewards and their probabilities, so you can know exactly what you're aiming for:
