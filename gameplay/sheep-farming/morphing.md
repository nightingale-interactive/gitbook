# Morphing

### Before you begin

You'll need two sheep of the same grade in your wallet, as well as enough MARD to cover the morphing fee. Any two sheep you would like to morph must be of different genders.



### Morphing your sheep

Navigate to our website's Shop menu and click the Sheep Morphing tab.

* Select one male and one female sheep of the same grade from among the available options.

![< Two sheep are loaded >](../../.gitbook/assets/sheeploaded.png)

* Once your two sheep are ready, you can begin morphing them for a standard fee.

* Once morphing is complete, you will be able to locate your new sheep in the Real-world section of the Inventory menu.

### Morphing Fees and Probability



#### **Fees**

|   Sheep Rarity  | Standard Morphing | Advanced Morphing |
| :-------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| Normal + Normal |      10 MARD      |      20 MARD      |
|   Rare + Rare   |      25 MARD      |      50 MARD      |
|   Epic + Epic   |        N/A        |        N/A        |

****

**Probability for higher grades**

|   Sheep Rarity  | Standard Morphing | Advanced Morphing |
| :-------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| Normal + Normal |        12%        |        17%        |
|   Rare + Rare   |         7%        |        12%        |
|   Epic + Epic   |        N/A        |        N/A        |

* With every Normal + Normal morph, there is a 0.1% possibility of an Epic sheep emerging.
* Morphing can result in any random type and gender within the same grade.
* Morphing Epic sheep is not currently possible, but will become available once higher grades of sheep are introduced.



### Some important factors to keep in mind

* Morphing will never result in sheep of lower rarity than the ones you started with.
* Morphing results will never include any of the original sheep you selected.
* The moment you begin morphing, there is no way to undo the process. And because your valuable NFTs are on the line, you should never morph any sheep unless you are absolutely certain you want to.
* Please be patient as your morphing is in progress. Processing may take a while depending on the stability of the Mainnet.

### Discover new sheep

Certain sheep are more difficult to come by than others, and some can only be obtained through morphing!
