The game is accessible across various platforms, allowing you to effortlessly import and export your account between them. When you begin your journey for the first time, you're provided with a starting wallet address (account). However, it's crucial to remember that neglecting to export this account code may lead to its permanent loss when importing another account to your device.

The ability to transfer your game account offers a convenient means of smoothly migrating your progress and possessions between different devices.
