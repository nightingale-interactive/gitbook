# Combo List



The initial release of the combo list occurred on 4 March 2022. This list will be updated on a regular basis, with new combinations being added as time goes on. Certain collaboration items, such as "Klay Dragons" may potentially trigger combination effects and will be added to the combo list in the future.

The same combo can only be activated once in a single pasture. e.g.)

* Plain White 1 + Plain White 2 = Ordinary Couple (O)
* Plain White 3 + Plain White 4 = Ordinary Couple (X)

The same type of combo can only be activated at a higher level in a single pasture. e.g.)

* Pink Baa-jama Lamb + Pink Baa-jama Lamb = Counting sheep(Lv.1) (X)
* Pink Baa-jama Lamb + Pink Baa-jama Lamb + Pink Baa-jama Lamb = Counting sheep(Lv.2) (O)
