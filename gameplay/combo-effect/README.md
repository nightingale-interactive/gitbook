# Combo Effect

Sheep are social creatures. While grazing, they usually stick together as a group. If a sheep is separated from the rest of the flock, it will become quite agitated. It is the banding together in groups that make them feel safe and happy! Bring out the best in them by grouping them with their friends, and youâ€™ll be able to trigger some powerful combo effects!



When it comes to running a sheep farm, combo effects are crucial. **Wool production might be significantly quicker** depending on which combination of sheep you hold! However, five rare sheep without a combo effect in your pasture will be less effective than five normal sheep with a combo effect enabled. Additionally, in order to trigger even more powerful combo effects, some combinations will require the use of rare sheep.
