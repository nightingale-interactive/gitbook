Assisting you in your crafting endeavours is Deolize, a reclusive potions expert in the mystical realm of Meta-land. With extensive knowledge and centuries of experience, she is the ultimate resource for crafting assistance. Her magical brews and crafts are known for enhancing the abilities of the village's sheep, aiding them in their quest to become masters of sheep racing.
