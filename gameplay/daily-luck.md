Daily Luck is a daily login reward feature hosted by the eccentric Chief of Mallowbu Island, Lucky Lenny. He encourages everyone to embrace life's unpredictability.



Each day, you'll have the chance to spin the prize wheel for a chance to claim rewards. This feature is available once a day, and once you exit the screen, you'll need to wait until the next day for another opportunity.



You'll receive one free spin on the prize wheel every day. If you're feeling lucky and want to spin again on the same day, you can use [<mark style="color:blue;">Lucky Coins</mark>](consumable-items.md). These coins are available in limited stock from the [<mark style="color:blue;">MARD shop</mark>](mard-shop.md) for a variable price that may change over time.



Once you've claimed all the rewards or acquired all three available sheep, you have the option to reset the game board. This allows you to start on a new cycle and win exciting new rewards!
