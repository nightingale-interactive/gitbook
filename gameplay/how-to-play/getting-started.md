* Sweet treats for feeding sheep are not NFTs and must therefore be purchased on our website ([https://sheepfarm.io](https://sheepfarm.io/)).

### Using NFTs in Meta-land

* To access NFTs in-game, you can transfer Sheepfarm NFTs to Meta-land via our website ([https://sheepfarm.io](https://sheepfarm.io/)).
* The website allows you to remove items from the game as well.
