* Sheep will produce wool quickly and get "Intimacy" if they feel beloved. And "Intimacy" of sheep is required for morphing("Intimacy will be updated at open beta season).

### Shearing sheep

* Shearing sheep on a regular basis provides users with wool. Unless the wool is sheared in a timely manner, the sheep will stop producing more wool.
* Sheep produce 1 bunch of wool per day, and it can be shortened by the decor and combo effects on the pasture.
* Shearing can be done automatically on the pastures of Stewart Island.
