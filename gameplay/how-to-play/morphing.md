  * For rare sheep morphing, you need to pay 25 MARD(Normal morphing) or 50 MARD (Advanced Morphing).
  * For epic sheep morphing is not available yet. It can be updated when higher grade of sheep appear.
  * Difference between Normal and advanced morphing will be 5% of chance to get higher grade of sheep.
