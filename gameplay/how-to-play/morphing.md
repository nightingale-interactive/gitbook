# Morphing

### Before you begin

1. You'll need two sheep of the same grade in your wallet, as well as enough MARD to cover the morphing fee.
2. Two sheep for using to morph shall have different gender.



### Morphing your sheep

* Navigate to our website's Shop menu and click the Sheep Morphing tab.

* Select one male and one female sheep of the same grade from among the available options.

* Once your two sheep are ready, you can begin morphing them for a standard fee.
  * For normal sheep morphing, you need to pay 10 MARD(Normal morphing) or 20 MARD(Advanced Morphing)
  * For rare sheep morphing, you need to pay 25 MARD(Normal morphing) or 50 MARD (Advanced Morphing).
  * Morphing Epic sheep is not currently possible, but will become available once higher grades of sheep are introduced.
  * The difference between normal and advanced morphing is that advanced morphing provides a 5% more increase in the probability of obtaining a higher-grade sheep.

* Once your morphing is complete, you will be able to locate your new sheep in the Real-world section of the Inventory menu.
  * The same kind of sheep which is used in morphing will not be appeared as a new sheep.
  * Please stay tune when you morphing process is going on. It may take some time to process due to Main-net network problems.
