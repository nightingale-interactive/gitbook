# Functional Decoration Items

Auto-petting and auto-cleaning decor items are active as soon as they are placed on a pasture. Having these on your pasture helps to eliminate the obligation for you to manually clean and pet your sheep. They are also helpful for receiving the bonuses that can be earned at random when you bathe or pet your sheep. Whenever your sheep need to be cleansed or petted, the mechanism of these useful decor items responds to meet their needs.\
