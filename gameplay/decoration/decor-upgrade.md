# Decor Upgrade

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)

Decorative items can be used as-is, but they can also be enhanced to make them more effective in their intended usage. Decoration items can be upgraded from the shop, and other decoration items can be used as a resource to upgrade them. Upgrades range from +1 to +9 and as the enhancement level grows, the itemâ€™s performance improves.



Upgrading does not always guarantee success. If you want to strengthen high-level decorative items even further, keep in mind that the enhancement level could possibly be reduced! As a result, decoration items with a high level of enhancement may sell for a high price on the NFT market simply because they are difficult to create.



_\*After the early access phase, the effect and upgrade mechanism for decoration items will be incorporated, as will additional features such as sheep morphing and combo effects._
