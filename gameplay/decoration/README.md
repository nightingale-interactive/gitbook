It may seem difficult to believe, but decorating a farm can have a positive impact on the mood of sheep. Decoration items will be an important aspect in sheep's daily lives since a well-decorated area such as a playground can make sheep feel as though they are in Sugarland.



Decor keeps sheep happy, which enhances their wool production while also allowing them to play with the many decorative pieces on the property. Make your sheep farm more attractive to ensure that your sheep stay comfortable and happy!



Decoration items only have an productive effect after +1 upgrade level. There will be no effect if the item has not been upgraded.
