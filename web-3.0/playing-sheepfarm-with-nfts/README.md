Marge, a respected and skilled figure in Meta-land, is renowned for her fashion expertise. She possesses a unique talent for crafting stylish clothing using locally-sourced wool, and her passion for fashion and her commitment to supporting local shepherds contribute significantly to the enrichment of the sheep farming culture in the village.

## Morphing NFT Sheep

**Sheep Morphing is an exclusive feature for Klaytn Network NFTs.** If you're eager to enhance your sheep's potential, try morphing! By combining two sheep of the same rarity, you have the chance to unlock a sheep of even higher rarity. Success is not guaranteed, but rest assured, it won't diminish the value of your sheep.



In Meta-Land, certain sheep breeds are harder to come by and can only be obtained through morphing. This adds an element of discovery, as you never know what unique sheep you might unlock through morphing. It's a way to expand your collection and add exclusive sheep to your flock.



To start morphing, you'll need a pair of sheep – one male and one female – with the same rarity. It's not possible to morph two sheep of the same gender. Take caution because once you begin the morphing process, there's no turning back. With some luck, you might end up with an even more remarkable sheep:

* Normal (male) + Normal (female) = Normal / Rare / Epic
* Rare (male) + Rare (female) = Rare / Epic



Morphing can be a gamble, but it could lead to a stronger addition to your flock. To morph your sheep successfully, you'll need to ensure a few things:

1. **Sheep Requirements**: You must have two sheep of the same grade in your wallet. Remember, these sheep must be of different genders.
2. **MARD Tokens**: You'll also need enough <mark style="color:blue;">MARD tokens</mark> to cover the morphing fee.



You can access the complete summary on the following page:[https://www.notion.so/ngit-interactive/MORPHING-DECOR-UPGRADE-SUMMARY-587602db8d014636b7ba7700160f87fc](https://www.notion.so/ngit-interactive/MORPHING-DECOR-UPGRADE-SUMMARY-587602db8d014636b7ba7700160f87fc)



### **Guide: Morph Your NFT Sheep**

1. **Access the Shop Menu**: Start by navigating to our website's Shop menu.
2. **Choose Sheep Morphing**: Click on the Sheep Morphing tab within the Shop menu.
3. **Select Your Sheep**: From the available options, choose one male and one female sheep of the same rarity. These will be the sheep you intend to morph.
4. **Initiate Morphing**: Once you've selected your pair of sheep, you can begin the morphing process. There will be a standard fee associated with this.
5. **Find Your New Sheep**: After the morphing is complete, you can locate your newly morphed sheep in the Real-world section of the Inventory menu.



_**Important Factors to Consider**_

1. _**No Lower Rarity**: Morphing will never result in sheep of lower rarity than the ones you started with. Your newly morphed sheep will either maintain the same rarity or become a higher rarity._
2. _**Original Sheep Exclusion**: The results of morphing will never include any of the original sheep breeds you selected. This means that the sheep you initially choose for morphing won't be among the outcomes._
3. _**Irreversible Process**: Once you begin the morphing process, there is no way to undo it. This is a permanent transformation, so exercise caution and ensure you're certain about your decision before initiating morphing._
4. _**Patience is Key**: Please be patient as your morphing is in progress. The processing time may vary depending on the stability of the server, so allow for some time for the transformation to be completed._

## **NFT Decor Items and Upgrades**

NFT Decorative items can be used as they are or upgraded to boost their impact on wool production. Upgraded decor can noticeably accelerate wool production. You can perform upgrades for these decorative items through the [NFT menu](https://sheepfarm.io/upgrades) on our website, using other decoration items as resources. This feature is exclusively available for **Klaytn NFTs,** and it's important to understand that success is not always guaranteed when performing an upgrade.



**Upgrade Levels:**

* Decor items start at level 0 (zero) and have a minimal impact on wool output at this level.
* There are 5 upgrade levels available, ranging from +1 to +5, with each level significantly increasing the item's productivity.
* Active combo effects with decor items always work, regardless of the item's level.

**Effects:**

* The overall reduction in wool production time due to upgrades is determined by both the item's level and its surface area.
* Decor items with identical surface areas have an equivalent effect on wool production.
* As the item's level and size increase, the impact on wool production and the required materials for upgrades also increase.

**Weather-Related Properties:**

* Each decor item has weather-related properties that significantly influence its effectiveness.

**Effects Calculation:**

* The Decor and Combo system's effects are cumulative, meaning they add up rather than multiply.



A comprehensive summary can be found on[ this](https://www.notion.so/ngit-interactive/MORPHING-DECOR-UPGRADE-SUMMARY-587602db8d014636b7ba7700160f87fc) page.
