# Playing Sheepfarm with NFTs

Playing with NFTs in the game opens up a world of possibilities. You can acquire NFTs, including pastures, sheep, and decorations, from platforms like [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/sheepfarm), Palasquare, Oasys, and [Tofu NFT](https://tofunft.com/collection/sheepfarm-in-meta-land/items) to enhance your in-game experience. These virtual assets can be seamlessly transferred between Meta-land and the real world via our [website](https://sheepfarm.io/).

Accessing your collection of Sheepfarm NFTs is straightforward; simply connect your wallet to view them at the [inventory](https://sheepfarm.io/inventory) menu on the website. You can easily identify whether your in-game item is an NFT and on which network it is based by a small badge displayed as an indicator on the corner of the item when viewing it on the website.

Playing with NFTs in the game brings tangible benefits. You can profit by selling the wool produced by your NFT sheep for <mark style="color:blue;">MARD tokens</mark>. You also have the flexibility to transfer your NFTs to other wallets or sell them on third-party marketplaces, where you have complete ownership of your items if you wish to part ways with them.



In an exciting new development, you can now <mark style="color:blue;">mint non-NFT in-game items into NFTs</mark>, offering exciting possibilities for your virtual assets. This feature is amazing for NFT collectors looking to enhance their in-game collections.
