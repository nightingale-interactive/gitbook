# vNGIT

vNGIT is a voting token that players may use to cast their votes on which features and components will be added to the in-game environment.&#x20;



Participants in governance who use vNGIT are delegated duty and authority for deciding key topics. These decisions include, among other things, the types of sheep that will be featured in Lucky Boxes, in-game weather, and other similar matters.



More details regarding vNGIT will become available as the development of the voting feature progresses.
